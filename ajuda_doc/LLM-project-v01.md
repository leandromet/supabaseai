### *Key Components*  
1. *Conversational Interface*:
   - Use the GPT model for natural language interaction to gather requirements like:
     - Area of interest (e.g., country, region, custom bounding box).
     - Type of data (e.g., land use, climate, population density, biodiversity).
     - Analysis needed (e.g., time-series trends, spatial correlations, feature classification).
   - Example:  
     User asks: "Show me deforestation trends in Brazil's Amazon from 2000 to 2020."  
     System responds with relevant datasets and maps.

2. *Data Integration*:
   - Pull open geospatial datasets from:
     - *OpenStreetMap (OSM)* for infrastructure and land use.
     - *NASA EarthData* for climate and environmental data.
     - *Copernicus Open Access Hub* for satellite imagery.
     - *Local portals* for government and academic datasets.
   - Automate fetching and preprocessing data with tools like Python (requests, GDAL, rasterio).

3. *Interactive Maps*:
   - Use *Mapbox GL JS* or *Deck.gl* for rendering maps in React or Vue.js.
   - Incorporate features like:
     - Layer controls (toggle between datasets).
     - Time sliders for temporal datasets.
     - Filters for user-selected attributes (e.g., vegetation type, elevation range).
   - Highlight regions of interest dynamically based on user input.

4. *Geospatial Analysis*:
   - Perform basic analyses using Python libraries like *GeoPandas, **Shapely, or **PostGIS*:
     - Overlay analysis: Combine datasets to identify intersections (e.g., deforestation and protected areas).
     - Heatmaps: Visualize population density or climatic variations.
     - Classification: Group land types or analyze spatial clusters.
   - Integrate pre-trained or fine-tuned AI models for advanced tasks like object detection in satellite imagery.

5. *Report Generation*:
   - Allow users to export analysis as a PDF or interactive web link.
   - Include annotated maps, charts, and dataset references.

### *Step-by-Step Guide*

#### *1. Build the Foundation*
- **Backend**: Use Python (e.g., FastAPI) to handle data queries, processing, and serving AI interactions.  
- **Frontend**: Use React for a responsive interface with mapping libraries like **Mapbox GL JS** or **Leaflet**.  
- **Database**: Set up PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data storage and querying.  

#### *2. Develop AI for User Interaction*
- Train or fine-tune a GPT-like model to interpret user queries and map them to geospatial needs:
  - Example: "I want flood-risk maps for Southern Brazil." or "My business supply natural food for schools and I want to expand in the Okanagan region in Canada."
  - Model response: "I recommend combining precipitation data from NASA with land elevation models of the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Would you like to include urban areas and forest vegetation?" or "I suggest using a British Columbia school location map with total students labels and district management buildings with addresses to help searching."

#### *3. Integrate Open Data APIs*
- Use APIs to fetch live data:
  - *OpenStreetMap*: OSM Overpass API.
  - *EarthData*: NASA’s APIs for environmental and climate datasets.
  - *Local Data Portals*: National/regional open data platforms.  

#### *4. Implement Interactive Mapping*
- Visualize datasets dynamically:
  - Display boundaries, raster layers, and vector overlays.
  - Add interactivity (e.g., click-to-view metadata or stats).

#### *5. Add Geospatial Analytics*
- Integrate Python geospatial libraries to:
  - Calculate areas of change (e.g., urban sprawl).
  - Create heatmaps or contour maps.

**Test and Iterate**
- Collaborate with real researchers to refine the system based on feedback.
- Expand dataset compatibility as needed.

---

### *Example Use Case*
1. A climate researcher asks: "Show temperature trends and deforestation in the Amazon from 2000 to 2020."
2. The platform fetches relevant datasets from NASA (temperature) and Global Forest Watch (deforestation).
3. It generates an interactive map with:
   - A time slider showing deforestation over the years.
   - Overlaid temperature trends as a heatmap.
   - Exportable charts and analysis reports.

---

### *Learning Outcomes*
- Hands-on experience with AI for user input processing.
- Familiarity with geospatial data formats (GeoJSON, shapefiles, raster).
- Proficiency in interactive mapping tools and open data integration.
- Insight into researchers' geospatial needs and how to address them.



### *System Workflow*
1. *User Input*:
   - Researchers provide a query or description of their needs (e.g., "I need a heatmap of population density in coastal regions prone to flooding in Southeast Asia.").

2. *Local Model*:
   - Your local model:
     - Parses the input and extracts key details (area of interest, type of data, type of analysis).
     - Generates a structured prompt for the OpenAI API, ensuring it includes necessary details.

3. *API Interaction*:
   - The prompt is sent to OpenAI’s GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo via the API.
   - The larger model generates refined outputs, such as:
     - A detailed analysis plan.
     - Suggested datasets and methods.
     - Additional clarifying questions for the user.

4. *Result Processing*:
   - The response from OpenAI is processed and used to:
     - Fetch or suggest relevant datasets.
     - Configure the interactive map automatically.
     - Provide feedback or suggestions to the user.

5. *Final Output*:
   - The platform delivers visualizations, analytics, or an exportable report based on the AI-driven suggestions.

### *Implementation Steps*

#### *1. Local Model for Prompt Generation*
- Use a lightweight local model (e.g., GPT4All or LLaMA) to preprocess user input:
  - Example Prompt Output:  
    plaintext
    The user wants to analyze coastal regions in Southeast Asia prone to flooding.  
    Objectives: 
      - Visualize population density.
      - Identify flood-prone areas using elevation and rainfall data.  
    Datasets: OpenStreetMap, NASA EarthData.
    Questions:  
      - What year range should the analysis cover?  
      - Should it focus on urban or rural regions?
    
- Fine-tune the local model if necessary for better domain-specific responses.

**API Call to OpenAI**
- Use the OpenAI Python client to send structured prompts from your local model:
  python
  import openai

  openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

  prompt = "Analyze flooding risks in Southeast Asia with the following parameters: ..."

  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
      model="gpt-4",
      messages=[
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a geospatial analysis assistant."},
          {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
      ]
  )
  result = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
  print(result)
  

#### *2. Handle API Response*
- Parse the API's output and integrate it into your application:
  - Fetch datasets using the suggested sources.
  - Configure layers and visualizations on your map.
  - Generate an analysis report based on the recommendations.

#### *3. Build Feedback Loop*
- Use the OpenAI response to improve local prompt generation:
  - Refine the local model’s outputs based on feedback from the API.
  - Implement logging to analyze API responses and enhance your system.
